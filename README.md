<br> Medium deal size dominate total sales with over 50% of the total, followed by small deal size, and then large deal size.
<br>
<br> 
**Conclusion**
<br> 1. Products with high sales are personal/small vehicles. 
<br> 2. Peak sales occur in November.
<br> 3. Medium transaction sizes contribute the most to total sales.
<br>
<br>
**Recommendation**
<br> 1. Leverage the demand for small vehicles by optimizing production and marketing efforts.
<br> 2. Investigate the low train sales and explore strategies to increase demand, potentially through targeted promotions or product enhancements.
<br> 3. Strategically plan inventory and marketing campaigns to maximize sales during the observed September peak.
<br> 4. Reinforce the successful medium deal strategy and identify ways to further enhance its contribution to total sales.
<br> 5. Develop targeted initiatives to increase the volume of small and large deals, potentially through tailored packages or incentives.
